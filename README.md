# Weather App
Introduction
This Weather App is a sleek, user-friendly web application designed to display weather conditions for cities around the globe. Crafted with simplicity in mind, it showcases the current weather status, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and visual icons representing the weather conditions. The app provides an intuitive interface for users to input a city name and country, with a design that emphasizes readability and ease of use.

Features
Aesthetic and minimalist design with responsive input fields for city and country.
Display features for temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions using placeholder icons and data.
A toggle switch for conceptual unit conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit (note: actual conversion functionality requires JavaScript, which is not included in this version).
Technologies
HTML5
CSS3
Project Structure
The project is structured with HTML and CSS files that define the layout and styling of the weather app. The main components include:

index.html: The HTML file contains the structure of the weather app, including input fields for city and country, placeholders for weather information, and the toggle switch for unit conversion.
style.css: This CSS file provides the styling for the weather app, including colors, layouts, and responsive design elements to ensure the app looks great on any device.
Setup
To get the Weather App running on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

Clone the repository or download the source code:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-app.git
Open the index.html file in a web browser to view the app.
Usage
The app currently displays placeholder data for weather conditions. To make it functional, you would need to integrate a weather API using JavaScript or another programming language that can handle API requests. Customize the app's appearance by modifying the style.css file according to your preferences.
